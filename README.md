# Operations-Efficiency-Forecasting-Dashboard
Solo Bot // Ops Console
An interactive, AI-powered dashboard for analyzing operational efficiency, forecasting demand, and identifying process bottlenecks using Google's Gemini API. The application features a futuristic, sci-fi terminal interface to visualize data and AI-driven insights.
(Note: You should replace the placeholder URL above with an actual screenshot of your running application.)
✨ Key Features
At-a-Glance Metrics: Displays key performance indicators (KPIs) like Total Orders, Service-Level Compliance, and Average Processing Time.
AI-Powered Analysis: Leverages the Google Gemini API to provide:
Demand Forecasting: Predicts future order volumes based on historical data.
Bottleneck Identification: Pinpoints potential inefficiencies in the operational workflow.
Actionable Recommendations: Suggests practical process improvements.
Interactive Visualization: Renders historical and forecasted data on a dynamic line chart using Recharts.
Futuristic UI/UX: A unique, immersive user interface inspired by sci-fi and hacker terminals, complete with animations and a typing effect for AI responses.
Responsive Design: Adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices.
Zero-Install Frontend: Runs directly in the browser using ES modules via ESM.sh, requiring no npm install or complex build setup.
🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: React (with Hooks), TypeScript
AI Engine: Google Gemini API (@google/genai)
Styling: Tailwind CSS
Charting: Recharts
Icons: Font Awesome
🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
To run this application, you only need a modern web browser and a way to serve the files locally. You will also need a Google Gemini API key.
Get a Google Gemini API Key:
Visit Google AI Studio to create your API key.
Installation & Setup
This project is configured to run without a local build process.
Clone the repository:
Generated bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
Use code with caution.
Bash
Set up the API Key:
The application is designed to source the API key from an environment variable process.env.API_KEY. Since this is a client-side application running without a Node.js backend or a build tool like Vite/Webpack, you'll need to make the key available to the browser.
A simple way to do this for local development is to create a setup-env.js file (and add it to your .gitignore!) and load it in your index.html.
a. Create setup-env.js:
Create a new file named setup-env.js in the project root:
Generated javascript
// IMPORTANT: Do NOT commit this file to version control!
window.process = {
  env: {
    API_KEY: 'YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE'
  }
};
Use code with caution.
JavaScript
Replace YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE with your actual key.
b. Update index.html:
Add a script tag to index.html in the <head> section, before the main application script.
Generated html
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    ...
    <title>Operations Efficiency & Forecasting Dashboard</title>
    
    <!-- Add this line -->
    <script src="/setup-env.js"></script>
    
    <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
    ...
</head>
Use code with caution.
Html
Run a local web server:
Because the app uses ES Modules, you need to serve the files from a local web server, not by opening index.html directly. The easiest way is using npx.
Generated bash
# If you have Node.js/npm installed, run this from the project root:
npx serve
Use code with caution.
Bash
If you don't have Node.js, you can use Python's built-in server:
Generated bash
# For Python 3
python -m http.server

# For Python 2
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
Use code with caution.
Bash
Open the application:
Open your browser and navigate to the local server address provided (e.g., http://localhost:3000, http://localhost:5000, or http://localhost:8000).
🕹️ How to Use
Observe Initial State: Upon loading, the dashboard displays key metrics and a chart of historical order data for the last 30 days. The "Solo Bot Terminal" is idle, awaiting commands.
Engage the AI: Click the hexagonal "Engage" button at the bottom. This will trigger a call to the Google Gemini API.
View Results:
The chart will update to show a new dashed line representing the 4-week order forecast.
The Solo Bot Terminal will come to life, typing out the analysis provided by Gemini, including identified bottlenecks and tactical recommendations for process improvement.
